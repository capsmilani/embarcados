Module "Bit1"      (component BitIO)
   - Bit1_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Bit1_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or 
                a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bit1_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Bit1_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "SM1"       (component SynchroMaster)
   - SM1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data).   For information about SW overrun behavior please see <General info page>.
   - SM1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel.
   - SM1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer.  Note: If the Interrupt service is disabled, 
                and the Ignore empty character is set to yes, and a character has been received, then this method returns 1 
                although it was an empty character.
   - SM1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer.

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)

Module "Bits1"     (component BitsIO)
   - Bits1_GetDir -Return selected direction.
   - Bits1_GetVal -Returns the value of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then reads the input value of 
                the pins and returns it. If the direction is [output] then returns the last written value (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations).
   - Bits1_GetBit -Returns the value of the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then 
                it reads the input value of the pin and returns it. If the direction is [output] then it returns the last 
                written value (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).

Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_MeasureChan -This method performs measurement on one channel. (Note: If the <number of conversions> is more than one 
                the conversion of the A/D channel is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetChanValue -Returns the last measured value of the required channel. Format and width of the value is a native 
                format of the A/D converter.
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD1_GetChanValue16 -This method returns the last measured value of the required channel. Compared with <GetChanValue> 
                method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD 
                resolution> is less than 16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.

Module "Bits2"     (component BitsIO)
   - Bits2_GetDir -Return selected direction.
   - Bits2_GetVal -Returns the value of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then reads the input value of 
                the pins and returns it. If the direction is [output] then returns the last written value (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations).
   - Bits2_PutVal -Specified value is passed to the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] saves the value to a 
                memory or a register, this value will be written to the pins after switching to the output mode - using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] it writes the value to 
                the pins. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits2_GetBit -Returns the value of the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then 
                it reads the input value of the pin and returns it. If the direction is [output] then it returns the last 
                written value (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).
   - Bits2_PutBit -Specified value is passed to the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is 
                [input] it saves the value to a memory or register, this value will be written to the pin after switching to 
                the output mode - using [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] 
                it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits2_SetBit -Sets (to one) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit, TRUE)]. 
                (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits2_ClrBit -Clears (sets to zero) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit, FALSE)
                ]. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits2_NegBit -Negates (inverts) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit,!GetBit(Bit)
                )]. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).

Module "Term1"     (component Term)
   - Term1_CRLF -Send CRLF to terminal.
   - Term1_SendStr -Send string to terminal.
   - Term1_SendNum -Send number to terminal.
   - Term1_SendChar -Send char to terminal.
   - Term1_Cls -Clear the terminal window.
   - Term1_MoveTo -Move cursor to position x, y. Range of coordinates can be from 1 to the size, which depends on the used 
                terminal. Position [1,1] represents the upper left corner.
   - Term1_ReadChar -Read char from terminal.
   - Term1_KeyPressed -Test if char was received from the terminal.

Module "Cpu"       (component MCF52259_144_LQFP)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables all maskable interrupts. This method sets the interrupt level mask group in the SR register by 
                value = 0.
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables all maskable interrupts. This method sets the interrupt level mask group in the SR register by 
                value = 7.
   - Cpu_SetIntLevel -Sets the interrupt level mask in the SR register. Interrupt requests are inhibited for all priority 
                levels less than or equal to current level, except edge-sensitive level 7 request, which cannot be masked.
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
