Module "Term1"     (component Term)
   - Term1_CRLF -Send CRLF to terminal.
   - Term1_SendStr -Send string to terminal.
   - Term1_SendNum -Send number to terminal.
   - Term1_SendFloatNum -Send a float number to the terminal. Due to the transformations the maximum float number is limited 
                according to the following conditions:     - positive number: 9 digits for integer part with 4 digits for 
                fractional part.     - negative numbers: 8 digits for integer part with 4 digits for fractional part.
   - Term1_SendChar -Send char to terminal.
   - Term1_Cls -Clear the terminal window.
   - Term1_MoveTo -Move cursor to position x, y. Range of coordinates can be from 1 to the size, which depends on the used 
                terminal. Position [1,1] represents the upper left corner.
   - Term1_ReadChar -Read char from terminal.
   - Term1_KeyPressed -Test if char was received from the terminal.

Module "Bits1"     (component BitsIO)
   - Bits1_GetDir -Return selected direction.
   - Bits1_GetVal -Returns the value of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then reads the input value of 
                the pins and returns it. If the direction is [output] then returns the last written value (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations).
   - Bits1_PutVal -Specified value is passed to the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] saves the value to a 
                memory or a register, this value will be written to the pins after switching to the output mode - using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] it writes the value to 
                the pins. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits1_GetBit -Returns the value of the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then 
                it reads the input value of the pin and returns it. If the direction is [output] then it returns the last 
                written value (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).
   - Bits1_PutBit -Specified value is passed to the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is 
                [input] it saves the value to a memory or register, this value will be written to the pin after switching to 
                the output mode - using [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] 
                it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits1_SetBit -Sets (to one) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit, TRUE)]. 
                (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits1_ClrBit -Clears (sets to zero) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit, FALSE)
                ]. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits1_NegBit -Negates (inverts) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit,!GetBit(Bit)
                )]. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)

Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_MeasureChan -This method performs measurement on one channel. (Note: If the <number of conversions> is more than one 
                the conversion of the A/D channel is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetChanValue -Returns the last measured value of the required channel. Format and width of the value is a native 
                format of the A/D converter.
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD1_GetChanValue16 -This method returns the last measured value of the required channel. Compared with <GetChanValue> 
                method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD 
                resolution> is less than 16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.

Module "Cpu"       (component MCF52259_144_LQFP)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables all maskable interrupts. This method sets the interrupt level mask group in the SR register by 
                value = 0.
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables all maskable interrupts. This method sets the interrupt level mask group in the SR register by 
                value = 7.
   - Cpu_SetIntLevel -Sets the interrupt level mask in the SR register. Interrupt requests are inhibited for all priority 
                levels less than or equal to current level, except edge-sensitive level 7 request, which cannot be masked.
