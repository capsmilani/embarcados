Module "I2C1"      (component Init_I2C_MCF)
   - I2C1_Init -This method initializes registers of the I2C module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)

Module "Cpu"       (component MCF52259_144_LQFP)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables all maskable interrupts. This method sets the interrupt level mask group in the SR register by 
                value = 0.
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables all maskable interrupts. This method sets the interrupt level mask group in the SR register by 
                value = 7.
   - Cpu_SetIntLevel -Sets the interrupt level mask in the SR register. Interrupt requests are inhibited for all priority 
                levels less than or equal to current level, except edge-sensitive level 7 request, which cannot be masked.
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
